# Mike Merritt's Projects Created from Public Data

These simple projects show methodology and tool usage without exposing sensitive company data.

## 1. Dashboard Methodology

First large amounts of data needs to be collected.  This can be public data downloaded or scraped from websites or it can be queried from private databases.  Often this data is not immediately in a useable form and must be processed in order to make sure the data type are

Write algorithems to locate signals.

Test the algorithem to make sure it is finding what is necessary.

Release the code to inspect the global dataset and find data streams that meet the perscribed conditions.

## 2. Getting Detailed

Digging deep into data often uncovers details that aren't noticeable when looking at summaries, take the 2020 Presidential Election summary for instance.  Showing a map with the states colored according to who won that state is an effective image for showing how each candidate received their electoral votes, but does it provide any insight as to how the populace voted?  Was it a landslide or a close victory?

Collecting the voting results data by county and then shading each county along a continuous color scale allows us to inspect the voting results in detail without cluttering the chart.  Many states show large areas of muted colors showing close races while others show definite strongholds for each candidate are clearly visible in the darker colors.  The chart is still simple and easy to read but shows much more information.

## 3. Staying Grounded

Its not always best to stay in the details, it is often necessary to take a step back and take a macro view of the data.

The convergence indicators on the chart were simply calculated by looking at each individual date from the mortality data and watching for how long the value for that day took to stabilize.  From the chart below we can see that for most dates the mortality counts approach their final value between weeks five and six:

## 4. Animation

Often showing patterns in data that changes with time can be made more effective with animation.  There are other times when showing a concept is easier with animation.

Github doen't support in-web viewing of animation at the moment and many animation files are too large to upload in GIF form.  I'd be happy to show you more when we speak!
