# Mike Merritt's Projects Created from Public Data

These simple projects show methodology and tool usage without exposing sensitive company data.


## 1. Dashboard Methodology

First large amounts of data needs to be collected.  This can be public data downloaded or scraped from websites or it can be queried from private databases.  Often this data is not immediately in a useable form and must be processed in order to make sure the data type are

## 2. Getting Detailed

Digging deep into data often uncovers details that aren't noticeable when looking at summaries.

## 3. Staying Grounded

Its not always best to stay in the details, it is often necessary to take a step back and take a macro view of the data.

## 4. Animation

Often showing patterns in data that changes with time can be made more effective with animation.  There are other times when showing a concept is easier with animation.

Github doen't support in-web viewing of animation at the moment, but I'd be happy to show you more when we speak.
